#SelfRubric
by Francisco Nieto
Alameda County Office of Education

This half-cooked Google Apps Script will display a sidebar with rubric options that a student can use to self-evaluate 
their writing on a Google Doc. After the sidebar opens, a table summary of their entries will be inserted at the end of the doc.
